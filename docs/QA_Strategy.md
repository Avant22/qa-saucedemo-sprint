## Entry Criteria
Stories in scope are defined, tests runnable locally, credentials available, no open P0s blocking smoke.

## Exit Criteria
All P0/P1 fixed or consciously deferred with sign-off; regression checklist green; report archived.

## Reporting
Daily notes in repo issues; automated HTML test report per run; release sign-off doc.
